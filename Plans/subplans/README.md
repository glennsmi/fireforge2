# Stage subplans

This folder contains per‑phase subplans with task checklists, links, and a short learning log. Update them continuously as we learn.

Conventions:
- Use Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`).
- Keep tasks small and actionable; include an explicit "Docs" and "Tests" item for each feature.
- Record decisions in an ADR entry and link it from the subplan.

Subplans:
- Phase 1: Foundation — `phase-1-foundation.md`
- Phase 2: File ingestion + chart creator — `phase-2-file-ingestion.md`
- Phase 3: Dashboards — `phase-3-dashboards.md`

Template: `TEMPLATE.md`
