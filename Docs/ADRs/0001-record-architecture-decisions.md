# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-08-09

## Context
We need a lightweight, durable way to capture important decisions with their context and consequences.

## Decision
Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored under `Docs/ADRs/`. Each ADR:
- Uses incremental numbering
- Includes status and date
- Links to related PRs/issues

## Consequences
- Better traceability and onboarding
- Changes require updating or superseding ADRs
