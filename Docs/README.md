# FireForge Docs

This directory contains living documentation for architecture, decisions, and standards.

Structure:
- Architecture — system overviews, sequences, component diagrams (Mermaid)
- ADRs — Architecture Decision Records capturing key choices and context
- Standards — coding, testing, security, and ops rules we enforce

Conventions:
- Keep docs short and high-signal. Link to code and PRs.
- Use Mermaid for diagrams.
- Update docs in the same PR as the code change when possible.
